# Podomoro-Timer
Welcome to the Pomodoro Timer project! This simple web application helps you implement the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by 5-minute breaks. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
